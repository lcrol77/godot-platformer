## Lessions Learned
### [Animation Player](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animationplayer.html) 
really powerful way too quickly animate certian sequences in Godot. In this project it is used to move the platforms back and forth. Uses key frames to cause the animations to load in the time line. In the example of the platform we take keyframes of the platforms transform to cause movement. But there are other things that can be keyframed.
### [Timer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_timer.html#timer)
simple way to do something after a time out. listen to the timeout signal
### [TileMap](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tilemap.html)
while this feature is now **deprecated**, it was really insightful to learn how easy it is to work with tile maps in godot. One piece that was really really useful was the ability to paint physics colliders on to the tiles by default see [video](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?t=1238).
### [World Boundry](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_worldboundaryshape2d.html#class-worldboundaryshape2d)
easy way to create infinite boundries
### [Kill Zone Concept](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?t=2060)
can leave child nodes off to be attached on later. Lets scene node be more flexable.
### [AnimatedSprite2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite2d.html)
easy way to amimate with a sprite sheet
### [Raycast](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_raycast2d.html)
